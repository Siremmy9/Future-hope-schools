   config.js  -  THE ONE FILE TO EDIT WHEN CLONING THIS TEMPLATE FOR ANOTHER SCHOOL
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Everything on the public website and in the admin dashboard reads from this
   object. Edit the values directly in this file, save, and re-upload the site.
   (Staff, gallery, news, facilities and fees are in js/content.js.)

   Placeholders (e.g. "234XXXXXXXXXX") are deliberate. Replace them with real
   details before going live. Nothing here is invented: where the school did
   not provide a fact, a clearly marked placeholder is used.
